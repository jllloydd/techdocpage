            Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
            </li>
            <li>
              Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
            </li>
            <li>
              Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
            </li>
            <li>
              Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
            </li>
            <li>
              Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.

            <li>
              Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
            </li>
            <li>Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.</li>
            <li>
              Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
            </li>
            <li>
              Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
            </li>
            <li>
              Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.

            <li>
              Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
            </li>
            <li>
              Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
            </li>
            <li>
              Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.

          Python is an interpreted programming language, this means that as a developer you write Python (.py) files in a text editor and then put those files into the python interpreter to be executed. Open a text editor of your choice and write your first "Hello world" Python code:
          <code
            >print("Hello, World!")
          </code>
Save the file as [file name of your choice].py and use a compiler to run the code to see the output!

        <p>
          Python has no command for declaring a variable.
        </p>
        <p>
         A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
        </p>

        <article>
          <p>
            As said in the preceding section, you just have to assign values to a variable name of your choice. For instance, you can create an x value by giving it a value as such:<code>x = 5</code> This
          </p>
          <p>
            This can also apply for other data types, such as a string, but they must be enclosed in quotation marks.
            <code>y = "John"</code> 
          </p>
          <p>
            You can use the print command to check the output as such:<code> print(x)
print(y)</code> Try it out in your python compiler!

        <header>Variable Names</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
          </p>
          <li>
              A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.
          </li>
          <li>
              A variable name cannot start with a number.
          </li>
          <li>
              A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ).
          </li>
          <li>
              Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables). 
          </li>

          <p>
            Here are examples of legal variable names:
          </p>

          <code>myvar = "John"
                my_var = "John"
                _my_var = "John"
                myVar = "John"
                MYVAR = "John"
                myvar2 = "John"
          </code>
          <p>
            Here are examples of illegal variable names:
          </p>

          <code
            >2myvar = "John"
             my-var = "John"
             my var = "John"
          </code>

        <article>
          <p>
            Variables that are created outside of a function (as in all of the examples above) are known as global variables.
          </p>

          <p>
Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.
          </p>
          <p>
Here is an example of a global variable being created outside a function and used inside the function:
          </p>

          <code
            >x = "awesome"

def myfunc():
  print("Python is " + x)

myfunc()
          </code>

        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Local_Variables">
        <header>Local Variables</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            If you create a variable with the same name inside a function, this variable will be local, and can only be used inside the function. The global variable with the same name will remain as it was, global and with the original value.
          </p>

          <code>x = "awesome"

def myfunc():
  x = "fantastic"</code>
          <p>
            The code snippet above shows the creation of a local variable.
          </p>

          <code
            >x = "awesome"

def myfunc():
  x = "fantastic"
  print("Python is " + x)

myfunc()
</code>
          <p>If we call the function, it will make use of the local variable. Try to test the code and see for yourself.
          </p>
          <code
            >x = "awesome"

def myfunc():
  x = "fantastic"
  print("Python is " + x)

myfunc()

print("Python is " + x)
</code>
        <p>The code above shows the use of both the global and local variable.

        <article>
          <p>Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Text Type:  str
            </li>
            <li>
              Numeric Types:  int, float, complex
            </li>
            <li>
              Sequence Types: list, tuple, range
            </li>
            <li>
              Mapping Type: dict
            </li>
            <li>
              Set Types:  set, frozenset
            </li>
            <li>
              Boolean Type: bool
            </li>
            <li>
              Binary Types: bytes, bytearray, memoryview
            </li>
            <li>
              None Type:  NoneType
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            You can get the data type of any object by using the type() function:
          </p>

          <code>x = 5
print(type(x))</code>

          <p>
            If you want to specify the data type, you can use the following constructor functions:
          </p>

          <code>x = str("Hello World")
            x = int(20)
            x = float(20.5)
            x = complex(1j)
            x = list(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))
            x = tuple(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))
            x = range(6)
            x = dict(name="John", age=36)
            x = set(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))
            x = frozenset(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))
            x = bool(5)
            x = bytes(5)
            x = bytearray(5)
            x = memoryview(bytes(5))

        <article>
          Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

          <li>
              Equals: a == b
          </li>
          <li>
              Not Equals: a != b
          </li>
          <li>
              Less than: a < b
          </li>
          <li>
              Less than or equal to: a <= b
          </li>
          <li>
              Greater than: a > b
          </li>
          <li>
              Greater than or equal to: a >= b
          </li>

          <code>if (condition):
            statement
          </code>
          Python relies on indentation (whitespace at the beginning of a line) to define scope in the code. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.
          <p>
            Every statement below if statements must be indented from the left.
          </p>

          The <b>elif</b> keyword is pythons way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".

          <code
            >if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")
          </code>

          The <b>else</b> keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.

          <code
            >if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")
else:
  print("a is greater than b")</code
          >
          If you have only one statement to execute, you can put it on the same line as the if statement.
          <code>if a > b: print("a is greater than b")</code> 

          If you have only one statement to execute, one for if, and one for else, you can put it all on the same line:

          <code>print("A") if a > b else print("B")</code>

          You can also have multiple else statements on the same line:

          <code>print("A") if a > b else print("=") if a == b else print("B")</code>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="while_loop">
        <header>while loop</header>
        <article>
          With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.

          <code>i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1</code> 
  
  The code above will print i as long as i is less than 6.
          <p>
            The while loop requires relevant variables to be ready, in this example an indexing variable must be defined, i, which has been set to 1.
          </p>

          <p>
            With the <b>break</b> statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true:
          </p>

          <code>i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  if i == 3:
    break
  i += 1</code>
  
  When i is equal to 3, the loop will stop.

          <p>
            With the <b>continue</b> statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next:
          </p>

          <code>i = 0
while i < 6:
  i += 1
  if i == 3:
    continue
  print(i)</code>
  
  If i is equal to three, the program will continue to the nest iteration, if there is one.
          <p>
            With the else statement we can run a block of code once when the condition no longer is true:
          </p>

          <code>i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
else:
  print("i is no longer less than 6")</code>
Once i is iterated to be greater than 6, "i is no longer less than 6" will be displayed.
